Here you find links to material on probabilistic pragmatics and probabilistic programming (in WebPPL).

#### Probabilistic pragmatics

##### Main

[Probabilistic Language Understanding](https://michael-franke.github.io/probLang/): webbook on probabilistic models of pragmatic inference

**Caveat:** there are (at least) two versions of this book; we will be using only the version accessible through the link above!

##### Additional

- [Pragmatic language interpretation as probabilistic inference](http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/goodman-2016-underrev.pdf): A recent review of the Rational Speech Act framework
- [Probabilistic pragmatics, or why Bayes' rule is probably important for pragmatics](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zfsw.2016.35.issue-1/zfs-2016-0002/zfs-2016-0002.xml): Position piece by Michael Franke and Gerhard Jaeger
- [Probabilistic Models of Cognition](http://probmods.org/): An introduction to computational cognitive science and the probabilistic programming language WebPPL
- [Modeling Agents with Probabilistic Programs](http://agentmodels.org): An introduction to formal models of rational agents using WebPPL
- [Forest](http://forestdb.org): A Repository for probabilistic models

#### Probabilistic programming in WebPPL

##### Main

- [webppl.org](http://webppl.org): An online editor for WebPPL (use this for development!)
- [WebPPL Tutorials](https://mhtess.github.io/bdappl/): Basic tutorials for WebPPL
- [WebPPL documentation](http://webppl.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

##### Additional 

- [The Design and Implementation of Probabilistic Programming Languages](http://dippl.org): An introduction to probabilistic programming languages, WebPPL in particular
- [WebPPL-viz](http://probmods.github.io/webppl-viz/): A summary of the vizualization options in WebPPL
- [RWebPPL](https://github.com/mhtess/rwebppl): If you would rather use WebPPL within R
